# Image Geolocation Processor

## what to build

The **Image Geolocation Processor** is a comprehensive Node.js application that intelligently adds GPS coordinates to photos that lack location data. It analyzes image timestamps and uses multiple fallback mechanisms to determine where each photo was taken, leveraging Google Maps timeline data and nearby geotagged images.

## Core Problem It Solves

Many photos, especially older ones or those from cameras without GPS, lack location information. This program solves that problem by:

1. **Using timeline data**: Matching photo timestamps with your Google Maps location history
2. **Image cross-referencing**: Using nearby photos that do have GPS data
3. **Smart interpolation**: Calculating likely locations based on temporal and spatial relationships

## How to Use It

### Basic Usage

1. **Prepare your data**:
   - Export your Google Maps timeline data from [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/)
   - Place the `Timeline Edits.json` file in the `data/` directory
   - Have photos in a directory you want to process
   - the application will inspect your `Timeline Edits.json` and extract date and location information, merging this with any pre-existing info in data/location.json (if it exists) and then keep the location.json info in memory, to be updated as new info is discovered  from images on file; the app then discards its in-memory copy of the `Timeline Edits.json` file.

2. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts**:
   - Enter the directory path containing your photos (defaults to `~/pics`)
   - The program will process images automatically and show progress

### Command Line Usage

For automation or specific directories:

```bash
# Process a specific directory
npm start -- /path/to/your/photos

# Process test images
npm start -- test-subset/
```

### What Happens During Processing

The program runs in two main phases:

#### **Phase 1: Discovery and Analysis**

- Scans your photo directory recursively
- Extracts existing GPS data and timestamps from images
- Builds a database of photo metadata
- Augments timeline data location.json with GPS coordinates and dates from photos that already have them

#### **Phase 2: Geolocation Inference**

- For photos without GPS, tries multiple methods:
  1. **Timeline matching**: Finds GPS records within 60 minutes of photo timestamp
  2. **Enhanced fallback**: Progressive search (1h → 6h → same day) for distant locations
  Writes calculated GPS coordinates directly into image files
- Generates detailed reports of successes and failures
at the end it writes out the data/location.json file

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Overview

The application follows a modular service-oriented architecture:

```

### Key Technical Components

#### 1. **Geolocation Database System** (`geolocationDatabase.js`)

- **Purpose**: In-memory database with optional SQLite persistence
- **Implementation**: Priority-based GPS source management
- **Features**:
  - Database → EXIF → Timeline → Nearby Images priority chain
  - Incremental processing (only new/changed images on subsequent runs)
  - JSON export with complete source attribution

#### 2. **Interpolation Engine** (`interpolation.js`)

- **Primary Interpolation**: Uses Google Maps timeline data, cleaned up through location.json
  - Finds closest GPS record within 60-minute tolerance
  - Implements enhanced fallback with progressive search expansion (1h → 6h → same day)
  - Automatically filters placeholder entries with null coordinates, ignoring them
  
#### 3. **Timeline Processing** (`timelineParser.js` & `timelineAugmentation.js`)

- **Parser**: Converts Google Maps timeline JSON format to usable coordinates, in location.json
- **Augmentation**: Extracts GPS from existing photos and adds to timeline
  - Smart duplicate detection
  - Automatic backup creation
  - Extends timeline coverage for better interpolation

#### 4. **EXIF Processing** (`exif.js`)

- **Multi-format Support**: JPEG, TIFF, PNG, WebP, RAW formats (including Canon CR3/CR2)
- **Hybrid GPS Writing**: Uses piexifjs with exiftool fallback
- **Optimized Processing**: Direct exiftool integration for CR3 files

#### 5. **Performance Optimizations**

- **Database-first Approach**: Checks cached GPS data before expensive EXIF operations
- **Smart Format Routing**: CR3 files bypass custom parsing for direct exiftool processing
- **Memory Management**: Releases memory between batches, tracks peak usage
